# Aboveit 

If I spent more time on this project, I'd add some testing to the site, mocking the API and testing to see if my UI works correctly. I'd also like to add ESLint for code quality and consistency.

## Description

I've created an app where you can search for words in the dictionary. The app will update the browser history and let you click on synonyms or antonyms, rerouting to those words. I've solved this assignment using React Remix and TailwindCSS

## Features

- Search for words in the dictionary
- Update browser history with search results
- Click on synonyms or antonyms to reroute to those words

    ```
